# about: 
This is a Power BI application I did in April 2020, to visualize the cases and deaths of COVID-19 around the USA up until April 21, 2020. The report shows detailed information about cases and deaths by county (based on a selected state), as well as a visual and graphical representation of the counties’ cases and deaths. For example, mousing over a specific county on the map shows a graph of its cases and deaths from March 10 to April 21. Clicking on the county highlights it against the rest of the counties on the map and showcases its cases and deaths; the size of the circle represents the spread of COVID-19 in the county.
